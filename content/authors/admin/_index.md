My research focuses on the dynamics of the climate system. The main emphasis of my work is to study the influence of the ocean on local and global scales, through the analysis of observations and a hierarchy of numerical simulations. Recently, I have worked on a wide range of topics including ocean redistribution of heat and carbon under climate change, regional sea level rise, air-sea coupling and predictability in mid-latitudes, ocean turbulence in climate models, and uncertainty quantification.
